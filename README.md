# Birthday-Wish


A personalized birthday wish web page built using HTML and CSS. This project focuses on front-end layout design, simple animations, and creative presentation using pure HTML and CSS.
🎨 Features include a custom layout, message section, and future plans to add animations, background music, and PNG decorations.

🔧 Skills practiced:

HTML structure and semantic elements

CSS styling and layout

Animation basics

This is my second personal project in my web development journey. More updates coming soon!

This is not just code — it’s a digital birthday card made with heart. 💝
I created this birthday wish project using HTML and CSS for someone very special. From layout to text, every part is designed with emotions.

Still adding animations, colors, and final touches — but here’s the base version. A small gift, coded with love and passion.
